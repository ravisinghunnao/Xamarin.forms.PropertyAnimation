# Xamarin.forms.PropertyAnimation

This is an animation library for xamarin forms controls. We can animate any property with supported type. Currenlty this library has three types which can be animated.These are double, Integer and color. So if any control has any property with these types, we can animate that. 

This library has two type of animations.

1- Sequentionals.
2- Parallel.

In sequential property animation, each animation will start after completion of its previous animation but if we want to animate multiple properties parallely, We can use parellel property animation. 

Below are few examples of using this library.
